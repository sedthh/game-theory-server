Research process:
- Research subjects will fill out forms on taking part in the experiment and introduced to the idea
- Research subjects will give their information, and receive an ID, so all their data will be connected to the same ID throughout all the different sessions
- Research subjects will be able to select their avatar from a list of avatars (don't want to let them create one because it could take way too long)
- Players are given the options to either cooperate or defect. Their choice will increase their score depending on the choice of the opponent. 
- 2 player games (two people will take part in the experiment at the same time, although the engine allows more)
- Players start the session outside of VR by either seeing their opponent or not
- Players will get into VR and play multiple sessions there, at random places against random avatars
- Players end the session outside of VR by either seeing their opponent or not (opposite of how they have started the session)
- Research subjects will be told the entire truth about the experiment and asked further questions

Random places (with random rotations 0-360 degree) (random order):
- A place that looks similar to the real life research environment
- A videogame environment that looks artificial
- A pleasant scenairo (for example: a beach)
- An unpleasant scenairo (for example: a factory)
- An actual prison
- Inside a church

Random avatars (random order, after random waiting time):
- The avatar selected by the opponent (once)
- The avatar selected by the user (once)
- An avatar that is just a sphere/headset without eyes (once)
- Rest of the avatars should be also human like, they can be repeatedly chosen (male and female, all white because diversity in Hungary would give away the fake avatars)

All sessions will last for random 3-5 games (length unknown to players). 
Places can change during games (you can play a session against someone and have the environment change after the results are in). 

Players will see (1) their own total score and (2) the score received during the current session by both the player and their opponent.
The choice of the opponent must also be visibly signaled to the player. 
The outcome of the choices must also be visibly signaled to the player (opponent choice + your choice = result --> points increase this way).
Give them some time to look around when a new random place or new opponenet appears.

The first VR session should include some kind of basic tutorial on how to select your choice.
A loading message needs to be shown while the player is looking for a partner
